#``1  Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.

# assumptions: If an integer is the same as the input integer, we will not add it to the above or 
# below count
def print_count_of_numbers_above_or_below_threshold(numbers: list, threshold: int):
  above, below = 0, 0

  for number in numbers:
    if number > threshold:
      above += 1
    elif number < threshold:
      below += 1
  print('above: ' + str(above) + ', below: ' + str(below))

# calling our method
print_count_of_numbers_above_or_below_threshold([1, 5, 2, 1, 10], 6)

#2  Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.

# assumptions: I'm assuming we will return the string from the method and not print it.
def rotate_characters_of_string_n_times(input:str, rotations:int) -> str:
	input_length = len(input)
	rotation_destination_index = rotations % input_length
	
	return input[rotation_destination_index:] + input [0: rotation_destination_index]
	
# calling our method
rotate_characters_of_string_n_times('MyString', 2)

#3  If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?
For python, I would change the way it joins lists into strings. As of today, if you have an array of strings like the following: ['Hello', 'RTS', 'Labs']. The way we would join this into a string (with each element separated by a space) would be with the following code:

words = ['Hello', 'RTS', 'Labs']
' '.join(words)

Instead of 'join' being a method of a string, I would make it a method of a list as follows:

words = ['Hello', 'RTS', 'Labs']
words.join(' ')

Let us know if you have any questions! If you're good to go, please send us back your exercise at your convenience (please upload your response to a public git repository, such as Github).

For question 1, I assumed that if the input number were to also be in the array, we would not add it to the above and below counts.

For question 2, I'm assuming we will return the string from the method and not print it.
